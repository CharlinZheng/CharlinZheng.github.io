  abstract = {The co-simulation is becoming increasingly popular in the analysis and design of power electronic systems (PESs). However, effectively synchronizing system state changes caused by switches poses a challenge, as the existing methods often incur high-interaction time costs. Therefore, this article introduces an adaptive synchronization interface (ASI), leveraging the discrete-continuous characteristics of PES to minimize the number of synchronization points and accelerate co-simulation. The key-frame prediction algorithm precisely identifies the system state change caused by power electronic switches and the external system. Subsequently, the proposed ASI utilizes the key-frame to dynamically adjust synchronization step size, thereby enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of co-simulation. The ASI is deployed on a co-simulation prototype for Simulink and DSIM. Additionally, a case study involving a 10-kVA modular multilevel converter (MMC) demonstrates alignment with experimental results, the ASI achieving a 394-fold reduction in synchronization time costs, compared to the fixed time-step synchronization interface (FSI) while maintaining accuracy. The proposed ASI presents a promising co-simulation interface for accelerating PES co-simulations.},

  abstract = {With the increasing popularity of renewable energy and electric terminal equipment, the large-scale application of isolated bidirectional dc--dc converters (IBDCs) is growing. Among these converters, the dual active bridge (DAB) converter, as the core topology of IBDCs, has garnered significant attention due to its bidirectional power transmission capability, simple modularity, and wide soft-switching range. To enhance the efficiency of DAB, various multi-degree-of-freedom (M-DOF) modulation techniques and related solutions have been proposed. However, there is currently a lack of in-depth understanding and thorough comparison of different M-DOF modulation techniques, making it difficult to obtain the optimal solution for different application scenarios. Therefore, based on the latest research and contributions, this article provides an overview of M-DOF, including models, objectives, and algorithms. Furthermore, the existing typical M-DOF modulation techniques are compared through experiments, exploring the differences and advantages among these technologies. Through these analyses, this article offers robust support for the advancement and application of M-DOF modulation techniques in DAB converters.},

Besides merits of galvanic isolation and exceptional scalability, MMAB converters have inherent zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) turn-on operation under phase-shift modulation, which substantially reduces switching losses and leads to high efficiency. However, ZVS characteristics of the converters cannot be guaranteed under traditional single phase-shift modulation. Therefore, modulation techniques with additional control degrees of freedom, such as common phase-shift and universal phase-shift modulation strategies, are introduced to improve the ZVS performance of the converters over a wide operation range. A comparison of ZVS operation under diverse modulation strategies is analyzed in detail, and experimental results with tested efficiencies under extreme conditions have verified the ZVS analysis and improved effects.},

  abstract = {Phase-shift modulation has been widely adopted in dual active bridge (DAB) converters due to its simple implementation and great system performance. However, modular multiactive bridge (MMAB) converter, a multiport version of DAB, has poor efficiency performance under traditional single phase-shift control and lacks a comprehensive analysis of multiphase-shift modulation. In order to improve the efficiency under unfavorable working conditions, this article proposes a universal phase-shift (UPS) modulation scheme for MMAB as well as multiactive bridge converters where the port numbers can be flexibly scaled. A time-domain mathematical model under the UPS scheme is obtained by a decomposition-and-superposition modeling method. Based on the model, an optimization strategy, aiming at full zero-voltage-switching turn-on actions and minimized root-mean-square inductance currents, is proposed to reduce the overall power loss. The proposed optimization strategy takes simplicity, scalability, and optimization performance into consideration, and its optimization effects can be regarded as a global optimum. Finally, a four-port laboratory prototype of MMAB converters has been constructed. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed UPS control strategy within the full working range have been verified by experimental results.},

Real-time hardware-in-the-loop simulation is an effective and secure testing tool, but simulating the dynamic charging process of railway WPT systems is challenging due to the continuous changes in the nonlinear magnetic coupling components. To address this challenge, we propose an FPGA-based half-step implicit-explicit (IMEX) simulation solver. The proposed solver adopts an IMEX algorithm to solve the piecewise linear and nonlinear parts of the system separately, which enables FPGAs to solve nonlinear components while achieving high numerical stability. Additionally, we divide a complete integration step into two half-steps to reduce computational time delays. Our proposed method offers a promising solution for the real-time simulation of railway WPT systems. The novelty of our approach lies in the use of the IMEX algorithm and the half-step integration method, which significantly improves the accuracy and efficiency of the simulation. Our simulations and experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed solver, which provides a new approach for simulating and optimizing railway WPT systems with nonlinear magnetic coupling components.},

Conventional general-purpose integration algorithms assume nonlinearity within systems but face inefficiency in handling the piecewise characteristics of power electronic switches. While some specialized algorithms can adapt to the piecewise characteristics, most of these methods require systems to be piecewise linear. In this article, a numerical derivative-based flexible integration algorithm is proposed. This algorithm can adapt to the piecewise characteristic caused by switches and have no difficulty when nonlinear nonswitching components are present in the circuit. This algorithm consists of a recursive numerical scheme that obtains high-order time derivatives of nonlinear components and a decoupling strategy that further increases computational efficiency. The proposed method is applied to solve a motor derive system and a large-scale power conversion system to verify its accuracy and efficiency by comparing experimental waveforms and simulated results given by commercial software.

Traditional model-based voltage control methods struggle with the rapid energy fluctuations and uncertainties of these DGs. While multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has shown potential for decentralized secondary control, scalability issues arise when dealing with a large number of DGs. This problem lies in the dominant centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) framework, where the critics take global observations and actions. To overcome these challenges, we propose a scalable network-aware (SNA) framework that leverages network structure to truncate the input to the critic's Q-function, thereby improving scalability and reducing communication costs during training. Further, the SNA framework is theoretically grounded with provable approximation guarantee, and it can seamlessly integrate with multiple multi-agent actor-critic algorithms. The proposed SNA framework is successfully demonstrated in a system with 114 DGs, providing a promising solution for decentralized voltage control in increasingly complex power grid systems.},

However, accurate real-time simulation in high-frequency applications demands extremely small time steps, which poses significant computational and memory challenges. Explicit methods can achieve small time steps due to low-computational burdens, but have stability issues. In this article, the authors propose a topology-aware matrix partitioning (TA-MP) method, which adopts the implicit numerical algorithm to ensure stability, and uses iterative methods to solve the implicit equations. In detail, the PES matrix is partitioned into blocks with clear topological meanings, and its constant diagonal blocks are used to construct a constant iterative matrix. Since the iterative matrix is constant, the TA-MP method bypasses the limitations of using iterative methods in real-time simulations by predetermining the number of iterations. The TA-MP method eliminates the need to store inverse matrices for different topologies, requiring only matrix-vector multiplications, which are efficient on FPGA. The TA-MP method's effectiveness is validated with n-port active bridge converters on an FPGA board with a 25 ns step size, ensuring simulation accuracy at the highest switching frequency of 200 kHz while consuming only 1/15 the memory resources of the conventional method.},

  abstract = {Operation condition monitoring of power electronics' systems can improve analysis visibility for device administrators and researchers. However, the current sensor-based monitoring methods have limitations in accurately monitoring variables at multitimescales. This article presents a real-time digital mapped (RTDM) method for the sensorless multitimescale operation condition monitoring in power electronics' systems using field-programmable gate array simulators. The mathematical models of power converters are deployed in the simulator considering multitimescale characteristics. Both the digital simulator and the physical power converter are controlled by the same control signals, allowing the simulator to map the accurate operation conditions of the power converters without additional physical sensors. The RTDM method can monitor variables on the switching period timescale to the system transient timescale due to the consideration for the ideal switch modeling of the semiconductor switch. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated using a 30 kW dual active bridge converter as an example, through the integration of an experimental prototype and a simulator to create an RTDM platform. This method offers an easy and sensorless way to monitor multitimescale variables in power electronics' systems, providing a more comprehensive and visual analysis of their operation.},

To enhance design reliability and efficiency, real-time simulation is a popular method for testing control units of these devices. FPGA-based real-time simulation is considered a genuine alternative to CPU-based applications as control unit frequencies increase. Although automated tools can map simulation methods from floating-point high-level languages to fixed-point FPGA, manually selecting the fixed-point word length to meet precision requirements involves a significant amount of tedious and repetitive work. Word length selection also impacts FPGA hardware resource usage. This paper proposes an adaptive word length selection method under accuracy constraints to minimize hardware resources. The innovation lies in using error noise models to compute analytical expressions relating simulation model accuracy to word length. The adaptive word length selection process is combined with commercial high-level synthesis tools to achieve high resource optimization performance. A three-phase inverter example demonstrates the benefits of our method in calculating model accuracy and optimizing FPGA hardware resources in simulations.},

Unlike traditional sensor-based methods, digital twin technology fundamentally offers noninvasive and delay-free global state estimation, making it highly promising for advanced control. However, its implementation faces significant challenges in computational cost, parameter adaptability, and control integration. This article proposes a cognitive digital twin (CDT) framework that combines insights from the physical space with efficient numerical algorithms. Specifically, a mode-driven numerical solver is designed to improve computational efficiency, while a parameter-identification-based reconfigurable model ensures robust state tracking under parameter drift. By seamlessly integrating CDT-generated information with model predictive control (MPC), a CDT-MPC scheme is proposed to achieve high control performance without high-bandwidth sensors. Experimental validation on a 50 kHz four-port multiactive bridge converter demonstrates that CDT-MPC improves estimation accuracy by three orders of magnitude, achieves deadbeat dynamic response, and eliminates sensor sampling delays. These results highlight the CDT-MPC scheme as a fully digital and widely applicable solution for high-frequency control, advancing next-generation intelligent power converters.},

With the increase of PET capacity to the megawatt level. the problem of increased losses need to be taken seriously. As an important indicator of power electronic device designing, losses have always been the focus of attention. At present, the losses are generally measured through experiments, but it takes a lot of time and is difficult to quantitatively analyze the internal distribution of PET losses. To solve the above problems, this article first qualitatively analyzes the losses of power electronic devices and proposes a loss calculation method based on pure simulation. This method uses the Discrete State Event Driven (DSED) modeling method to solve the problem of slow simulation speed of large-capacity power electronic devices and uses a loss calculation method that considers the operating conditions of the device to improve the calculation accuracy. For the PET prototype in this article, a losses model of the PET is established. The comparison of experimental and simulation results verifies the feasibility of the losses model. Then the losses composition of PET was analyzed to provide reference opinions for actual operation. It can help pre-analyze the losses distribution of PET, thereby providing a potential method for improving system efficiency.},

This article presents an event-driven hardware-in-the-loop (ED-HIL) simulation framework that does not rely on the small fixed simulation step-size related to the switching frequency. ED-HIL framework can improve the calculation efficiency by positioning switch events and using variable simulation step-size. Further, a parallel acceleration and circuit partitioning (PACP) solver is proposed based on this framework. The PACP solver partitions the circuit with energy storage elements and ensures that the partitioning does not introduce simulation distortion by using the higher order derivatives of the energy storage elements. Meanwhile, it achieves a process-level paralleling through a shared memory architecture in order to accelerate the simulation. As a result, the proposed PACP solver based on the ED-HIL framework can achieve about three times the simulation scale of a commercial FPGA-based real-time simulator at 1/16 the hardware cost under the same conditions. An accurate real-time HIL example of a power electronic transformer with 32 switches at a switching frequency of 20 kHz has been implemented on a personal computer.

The complex PESs with high switching frequency constitute some of the most challenging applications in RT-HIL. Conventional RT-HIL relies on adding extra expensive computing hardware to achieve submicrosecond step size, reducing errors caused by unavoidable sampling delays. This article proposes a CPU-based event-driven RT (EDRT) simulation framework by improving the algorithm rather than using additional hardware. The framework consists of two parts: 1) the synchronous-cycle event detection sampling method, which eliminates the delay error by detecting switching events; and 2) the discrete hybrid time-step numerical algorithm, which combines variable and fixed step-size simulation to improve the calculation efficiency and uses the ideal model to improve the modeling accuracy. The proposed framework is applied to a power electronic transformer with 24 switches and a 20 kHz switching frequency as a simulated case. Comparing the proposed simulation results with experimental results and other simulation results, the proposed EDRT framework can achieve the same numerical accuracy as the offline simulation but only requires 1/36 of the computation time. Furthermore, the hardware cost to achieve the same computational scale is reduced to 1/20 of the conventional HIL.},

Therefore, this article presents a physical controller co-simulation (PCCO) approach to alleviate real-time constraints and satisfy controller testing requirements for MW-level PESs. Besides, an event-driven synchronization (EDS) framework is proposed to maintain consistent controller behavior in both the PCCO simulation and real -world systems, while using switch-event information to accelerate the simulation.

To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Physics-Embedded Neural ODEs (PENODE) that (i) embeds the hybrid operating mechanism as an event automaton to explicitly govern discrete switching and (ii) injects known governing ODE components directly into the neural parameterization of unmodeled dynamics. This unified design yields a differentiable end-to-end trainable architecture that preserves physical interpretability while reducing redundancy, and it supports a cloud-to-edge toolchain for efficient FPGA deployment. Experimental results demonstrate that PENODE achieves significantly higher accuracy in benchmarks in white-box, gray-box, and black-box scenarios, with a 75\% reduction in neuron count, validating that the proposed PENODE maintains physical interpretability, efficient edge deployment, and real-time control enhancement.},

  abstract = {Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) based Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation is an effective tool to verify the performance of physical controllers and shorten the development cycle of power converters. In HIL simulations, sampling accuracy is of concern and is desired to be improved by reducing the step size. However, due to the cost of computational time, the step size is hard to reduce indefinitely to meet the requirements for high switching frequency applications. To improve the sampling accuracy and simulation performance of HIL simulation, this paper proposes a semi-implicit parallel leapfrog (SPL) solver with half-step sampling technique. In this solver, the switches and the rest part of the system are implemented to be computed parallel when the switch leg model operates in continuous current mode. Besides, the solver is formulated in leapfrog format to reduce computational costs and to compute at half-step as a minimum step-size. With this format, the half-step sampling technique can be employed to increase the sampling rate by onefold, even in cases where it is challenging to reduce the simulation step size further. A dual active bridge converter case is implemented on the FPGA board with a 12.5-ns sampling step-size, retaining the simulation accuracy while switched at 400 kHz. To further verify the advantages, the results are compared with other HIL method and experimental results.},
