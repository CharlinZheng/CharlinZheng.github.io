    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

Jialin Zheng is a Postdoctoral Researcher at Purdue University and received his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Tsinghua University. His research lies at the intersection of edge computing, machine learning, power electronics, and energy systems, with interests in real-time digital twins, time-series modeling, and model predictive control. 

He develops provably correct and physically realizable theory, algorithms, and toolchains to drive the digitalization and intelligence of next-generation energy systems, improving performance, reliability, and resilience across wide-bandgap devices, high-frequency power converters, and converter-dominated grids.
