Jialin Zheng is a Postdoctoral Researcher at Purdue University and received his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Tsinghua University. His research lies at the intersection of edge computing, machine learning, power electronics, and energy systems, with interests in real-time digital twins, time-series modeling, and model predictive control. 

He develops provably correct and physically realizable theory, algorithms, and toolchains to drive the digitalization and intelligence of next-generation energy systems, improving performance, reliability, and resilience across wide-bandgap devices, high-frequency power converters, and converter-dominated grids.
