abstract: Power electronic systems are crucial in modern power grids. Accurate offline
  simulation tools are essential for analyzing such systems. However, the accurate
  simulation of large-scale power electronic systems is time-consuming especially
  when stray parameters are considered. This paper proposes a topology-aware iterative
  method to improve solving efficiency for large-scale power electronic systems with
  stray parameters. The proposed method includes a topology-aware partitioning strategy
  and a flexible preconditioning method to efficiently construct preconditioners that
  can adapt to different topologies and step sizes. With this method, a large-scale
  solid-state transformer with stray parameters is efficiently simulated. Over 300-fold
  acceleration is achieved in total compared with commercial software. The method
  makes it possible to analyze and design large-scale power electronic systems more
  reliably.
