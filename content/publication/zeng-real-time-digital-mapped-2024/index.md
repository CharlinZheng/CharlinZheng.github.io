abstract: Operation condition monitoring of power electronics' systems can improve
  analysis visibility for device administrators and researchers. However, the current
  sensor-based monitoring methods have limitations in accurately monitoring variables
  at multitimescales. This article presents a real-time digital mapped (RTDM) method
  for the sensorless multitimescale operation condition monitoring in power electronics'
  systems using field-programmable gate array simulators. The mathematical models
  of power converters are deployed in the simulator considering multitimescale characteristics.
  Both the digital simulator and the physical power converter are controlled by the
  same control signals, allowing the simulator to map the accurate operation conditions
  of the power converters without additional physical sensors. The RTDM method can
  monitor variables on the switching period timescale to the system transient timescale
  due to the consideration for the ideal switch modeling of the semiconductor switch.
  The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated using a 30 kW dual active
  bridge converter as an example, through the integration of an experimental prototype
  and a simulator to create an RTDM platform. This method offers an easy and sensorless
  way to monitor multitimescale variables in power electronics' systems, providing
  a more comprehensive and visual analysis of their operation.
