abstract: Edge Digital Twins (EDTs) are crucial for monitoring and control of Power
  Electronics Systems (PES). However, existing modeling approaches struggle to consistently
  capture continuously evolving hybrid dynamics that are inherent in PES, degrading
  Sim-to-Real generalization on resource-constrained edge devices. To address these
  challenges, this paper proposes a Physics-Embedded Neural ODEs (PENODE) that (i)
  embeds the hybrid operating mechanism as an event automaton to explicitly govern
  discrete switching and (ii) injects known governing ODE components directly into
  the neural parameterization of unmodeled dynamics. This unified design yields a
  differentiable end-to-end trainable architecture that preserves physical interpretability
  while reducing redundancy, and it supports a cloud-to-edge toolchain for efficient
  FPGA deployment. Experimental results demonstrate that PENODE achieves significantly
  higher accuracy in benchmarks in white-box, gray-box, and black-box scenarios, with
  a 75% reduction in neuron count, validating that the proposed PENODE maintains physical
  interpretability, efficient edge deployment, and real-time control enhancement.
