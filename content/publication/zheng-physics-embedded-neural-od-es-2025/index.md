abstract: Edge Digital Twins (EDTs) are crucial for monitoring and control of Power Electronics Systems (PES). However, existing modeling approaches struggle to consistently capture continuously evolving hybrid dynamics that are inherent in PES, degrading Sim-to-Real generalization on resource-constrained edge devices. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Physics-Embedded Neural ODEs (PENODE) that (i) embeds the hybrid operating mechanism as an event automaton to explicitly govern discrete switching and (ii) injects known governing ODE components directly into the neural parameterization of unmodeled dynamics. This unified design yields a differentiable end-to-end trainable architecture that preserves physical interpretability while reducing redundancy, and it supports a cloud-to-edge toolchain for efficient FPGA deployment. Experimental results demonstrate that PENODE achieves significantly higher accuracy in benchmarks in white-box, gray-box, and black-box scenarios, with a 75% reduction in neuron count, validating that the proposed PENODE maintains physical interpretability, efficient edge deployment, and real-time control enhancement.

summary: PENODE enhances edge digital twins for power electronics by unifying event-based switching and physics-informed neural modeling, enabling efficient and interpretable real-time control on FPGA.
