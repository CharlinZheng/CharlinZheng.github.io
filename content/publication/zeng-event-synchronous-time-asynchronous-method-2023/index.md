abstract: This letter presents an event-synchronous time-asynchronous (ESTA) method
  for controller hardware-in-the-loop (CHIL) simulations of modular multilevel converters
  (MMCs). The proposed method aims to address the issue of extensive power circuit
  simulation calculations, which may result in incomplete data interaction within
  an interaction cycle and, subsequently, cause CHIL simulation failure. Unlike the
  conventional time-synchronous simulations, the proposed ESTA method employs data
  interaction events to trigger simulation and control calculations. Furthermore,
  state and switching events are utilized to drive simulation calculations, reducing
  the calculation points of the simulator. As a result, the controller and simulator
  in CHIL systems exhibit synchronous event logic and asynchronous timing. The proposed
  ESTA method allows for the accurate CHIL simulations even when the simulator faces
  significant computational tasks. The simulated and experimental results from a 10
  kVA MMC are provided to validate the proposed ESTA method. This letter provides
  an effective method for simulating large-scale MMCs in the CHIL simulation system,
  offering a promising avenue for this field.
