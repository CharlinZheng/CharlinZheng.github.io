abstract: 'Real-time (RT) hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation aims to speed up the
  validation process for power electronic systems (PES). The complex PESs with high
  switching frequency constitute some of the most challenging applications in RT-HIL.
  Conventional RT-HIL relies on adding extra expensive computing hardware to achieve
  submicrosecond step size, reducing errors caused by unavoidable sampling delays.
  This article proposes a CPU-based event-driven RT (EDRT) simulation framework by
  improving the algorithm rather than using additional hardware. The framework consists
  of two parts: 1) the synchronous-cycle event detection sampling method, which eliminates
  the delay error by detecting switching events; and 2) the discrete hybrid time-step
  numerical algorithm, which combines variable and fixed step-size simulation to improve
  the calculation efficiency and uses the ideal model to improve the modeling accuracy.
  The proposed framework is applied to a power electronic transformer with 24 switches
  and a 20 kHz switching frequency as a simulated case. Comparing the proposed simulation
  results with experimental results and other simulation results, the proposed EDRT
  framework can achieve the same numerical accuracy as the offline simulation but
  only requires 1/36 of the computation time. Furthermore, the hardware cost to achieve
  the same computational scale is reduced to 1/20 of the conventional HIL.'
