abstract: Compared with silicon (Si) power devices, Silicon carbide (SiC) devices have the advantages of fast switching speed and low on-resistance. However, the effects of non-ideal characteristics of SiC MOSFETs and stray parameters (especially parasitic inductance) on switching losses need to be further evaluated. In this paper, a transient loss model based on SiC MOSFET and SiC Schottky barrier diode (SBD) switching pairs is proposed. The transient process analysis is simplified by time segmentation of the transient process of power switching devices. The electro-thermal simulation calculates the junction temperature and updates the temperature-related parameters with the proposed loss model and the thermal network model. A multi-rate data exchange strategy is proposed to solve the problem of disparity in timescales between circuit simulation and thermal network simulation. The CREE CMF20120D SiC MOSFET device is used for the experimental verification. The experimental results verify the accuracy of the model which provides guidance for the circuit design of SiC MOSFETs. All the parameters of the loss model can be extracted from the datasheet, which is practical in power electronics design.
