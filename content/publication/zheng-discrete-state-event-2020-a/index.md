abstract: At present, power electronic transformers (PETs) have been widely used in
  power systems. With the increase of PET capacity to the megawatt level. the problem
  of increased losses need to be taken seriously. As an important indicator of power
  electronic device designing, losses have always been the focus of attention. At
  present, the losses are generally measured through experiments, but it takes a lot
  of time and is difficult to quantitatively analyze the internal distribution of
  PET losses. To solve the above problems, this article first qualitatively analyzes
  the losses of power electronic devices and proposes a loss calculation method based
  on pure simulation. This method uses the Discrete State Event Driven (DSED) modeling
  method to solve the problem of slow simulation speed of large-capacity power electronic
  devices and uses a loss calculation method that considers the operating conditions
  of the device to improve the calculation accuracy. For the PET prototype in this
  article, a losses model of the PET is established. The comparison of experimental
  and simulation results verifies the feasibility of the losses model. Then the losses
  composition of PET was analyzed to provide reference opinions for actual operation.
  It can help pre-analyze the losses distribution of PET, thereby providing a potential
  method for improving system efficiency.
