 abstract = {Railway Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) is a promising non-contact power supply solution, but constructing prototypes for controller testing can be both costly and unsafe. Real-time hardware-in-the-loop simulation is an effective and secure testing tool, but simulating the dynamic charging process of railway WPT systems is challenging due to the continuous changes in the nonlinear magnetic coupling components. To address this challenge, we propose an FPGA-based half-step implicit-explicit (IMEX) simulation solver. The proposed solver adopts an IMEX algorithm to solve the piecewise linear and nonlinear parts of the system separately, which enables FPGAs to solve nonlinear components while achieving high numerical stability. Additionally, we divide a complete integration step into two half-steps to reduce computational time delays. Our proposed method offers a promising solution for the real-time simulation of railway WPT systems. The novelty of our approach lies in the use of the IMEX algorithm and the half-step integration method, which significantly improves the accuracy and efficiency of the simulation. Our simulations and experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed solver, which provides a new approach for simulating and optimizing railway WPT systems with nonlinear magnetic coupling components.},
