abstract: Railway Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) is a promising non-contact power supply
  solution, but constructing prototypes for controller testing can be both costly
  and unsafe. Real-time hardware-in-the-loop simulation is an effective and secure
  testing tool, but simulating the dynamic charging process of railway WPT systems
  is challenging due to the continuous changes in the nonlinear magnetic coupling
  components. To address this challenge, we propose an FPGA-based half-step implicit-explicit
  (IMEX) simulation solver. The proposed solver adopts an IMEX algorithm to solve
  the piecewise linear and nonlinear parts of the system separately, which enables
  FPGAs to solve nonlinear components while achieving high numerical stability. Additionally,
  we divide a complete integration step into two half-steps to reduce computational
  time delays. Our proposed method offers a promising solution for the real-time simulation
  of railway WPT systems. The novelty of our approach lies in the use of the IMEX
  algorithm and the half-step integration method, which significantly improves the
  accuracy and efficiency of the simulation. Our simulations and experiments demonstrate
  the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed solver, which provides a new approach
  for simulating and optimizing railway WPT systems with nonlinear magnetic coupling
  components.
