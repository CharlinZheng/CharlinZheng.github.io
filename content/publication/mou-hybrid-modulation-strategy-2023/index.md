abstract: This paper presents a hybrid modulation strategy (HMS) for modular quad-active
  bridge (QAB) converters to address the efficiency shortcomings of single phase-shift
  (SPS) modulation methods. The proposed HMS significantly bolsters the efficiency
  of the converter while maintaining the simplicity inherent to SPS, rendering it
  highly straightforward to implement in engineering applications. The HMS incorporates
  a DC bias capacitor to ensure the QAB converter operates under a half-bridge configuration
  during light load conditions and transitions to a full-bridge configuration under
  heavy load conditions. Due to the high coupling of the ports of the QAB converter,
  this paper determines port coefficients using the minimum mode of inductance root-mean-square
  current. Finally, an experimental prototype of a QAB converter is established and
  tested.
