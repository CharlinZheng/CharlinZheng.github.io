abstract: Controller Hardware-in-the-loop (CHIL) simulation is an efficient design
  tool that directly tests control programs and codes for power electronics converters.
  However, when dealing with widely-used modular multilevel converters (MMCs), completing
  extensive power circuit simulation calculations within one control cycle can be
  challenging due to the large number of modules involved. This paper proposes an
  event-driven CHIL simulation approach for an MMC with 60 submodules. Unlike conventional
  time-driven simulations, the proposed method utilizes data interaction events between
  the simulator and the controller to drive simulation and control calculations. The
  proposed simulation has asynchronous virtual and actual timings, and the switching
  frequency of the MMCs in the simulator remains unaffected by asynchronous timings.
  Finally, the proposed event-driven CHIL simulation is validated through both simulation
  and experimental results on a 10kVA MMC with 60 submodules.
