 abstract = {Controller cooperation simulations of power electronics systems can be used to test control strategies and codes efficiently and safely. However, with the switching frequency increment of power electronics systems, the data interaction between actual controllers and simulators requires more software and hardware improvements to ensure its accurate execution. This paper presents an easy-realized self-restoring fault-tolerant method for controller cooperation simulation of power electronics systems without extra software and hardware improvements. The proposed method is built in a controller cooperation simulation system based on CPU simulators and realized by transitorily rematching the control information and simulation data based on the time difference between controllers and simulators. Moreover, the proposed method only needs to modify the peripheral communication calling program and does not need to modify the calculation programs of the simulator. A 20kHz power electronic transformer as an example is built on the cooperation simulation system with and without the proposed method and the experimental prototype to verify the effect of the proposed method. This paper helps to build a controller cooperation simulation system with a self-restoring fault-tolerant, and further provides a fast and effective design and analysis tool for control strategies and codes of power electronics systems.},
