abstract: Controller cooperation simulations of power electronics systems can be used
  to test control strategies and codes efficiently and safely. However, with the switching
  frequency increment of power electronics systems, the data interaction between actual
  controllers and simulators requires more software and hardware improvements to ensure
  its accurate execution. This paper presents an easy-realized self-restoring fault-tolerant
  method for controller cooperation simulation of power electronics systems without
  extra software and hardware improvements. The proposed method is built in a controller
  cooperation simulation system based on CPU simulators and realized by transitorily
  rematching the control information and simulation data based on the time difference
  between controllers and simulators. Moreover, the proposed method only needs to
  modify the peripheral communication calling program and does not need to modify
  the calculation programs of the simulator. A 20kHz power electronic transformer
  as an example is built on the cooperation simulation system with and without the
  proposed method and the experimental prototype to verify the effect of the proposed
  method. This paper helps to build a controller cooperation simulation system with
  a self-restoring fault-tolerant, and further provides a fast and effective design
  and analysis tool for control strategies and codes of power electronics systems.
