abstract: Power converters have become increasingly important in the power industry.
  To enhance design reliability and efficiency, real-time simulation is a popular
  method for testing control units of these devices. FPGA-based real-time simulation
  is considered a genuine alternative to CPU-based applications as control unit frequencies
  increase. Although automated tools can map simulation methods from floating-point
  high-level languages to fixed-point FPGA, manually selecting the fixed-point word
  length to meet precision requirements involves a significant amount of tedious and
  repetitive work. Word length selection also impacts FPGA hardware resource usage.
  This paper proposes an adaptive word length selection method under accuracy constraints
  to minimize hardware resources. The innovation lies in using error noise models
  to compute analytical expressions relating simulation model accuracy to word length.
  The adaptive word length selection process is combined with commercial high-level
  synthesis tools to achieve high resource optimization performance. A three-phase
  inverter example demonstrates the benefits of our method in calculating model accuracy
  and optimizing FPGA hardware resources in simulations.
