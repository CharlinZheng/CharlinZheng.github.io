abstract: This article proposes an extended discrete-state event-driven (EDSED) controller hardware-in-the-loop (CHIL) method for power electronic systems, employing virtual-time-ratio (VTR) regulation to achieve CHIL function. Specifically, the proposed VTR in CHIL simulation is introduced to define the time ratio at which the mathematical model of the power circuit runs in the simulator. In addition, by adjusting different VTRs, the data interaction between the simulator and the controller is modified and employed as an event to trigger both simulation and control calculations, ensuring a precise correlation between simulation data and control information. The proposed EDSED CHIL simulation method is validated through CHIL and full hardware experiments involving a power electronic transformer (PET) and a multiport power router (MPR). This article offers an effective CHIL solution for testing control strategies and codes in power electronic systems characterized by complex coupling and high frequency.
