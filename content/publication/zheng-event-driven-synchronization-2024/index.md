abstract: Model-based design (MBD) technology has substantially enhanced safety, reliability,
  and efficiency in power electronic system (PES) controller development. However,
  conventional MBD technologies face real-time constraints when collaborated with
  physical controllers, posing challenges for applying them to megawatt-level (MW-level)
  PESs with numerous switches. Therefore, this article presents a physical controller
  co-simulation (PCCO) approach to alleviate real-time constraints and satisfy controller
  testing requirements for MW-level PESs. Besides, an event-driven synchronization
  (EDS) framework is proposed to maintain consistent controller behavior in both the
  PCCO simulation and real -world systems, while using switch-event information to
  accelerate the simulation. Moreover, a hybrid CPU-FPGA hardware platform is designed
  for the PCCO simulation, and a 2 MW power electronic transformer with 576 switches
  is implemented as the case study with the EDS framework. The results show that the
  EDS framework provides a high-accuracy numerical controller testing environment
  for MW-level PESs without altering the controller behavior. Comparative analysis
  with commercial HIL simulators, and prototypes indicates that the proposed framework
  supports safe and efficient testing of physical controllers in large-scale MW-level
  PESs, thereby promoting the use of MW-level converters in modern power grids.
