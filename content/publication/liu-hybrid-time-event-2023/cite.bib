 abstract = {Power electronic systems are characterized by multiple time scales, which makes simulation difficult. Current simulation tools are plagued with problems such as long simulation times, non-convergent results, and insufficient models. This paper proposes a co-simulation framework based on hybrid time-event synchronization that combines time-driven SIMULINK simulation algorithm and event-driven DSIM power electronics simulation algorithm, offering the benefits of fast convergence from DSIM and a rich model library from SIMULINK. The co-simulation framework takes the advantages of fast convergence from DSIM and rich model library from SIMULINK. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed framework are validated through the case study of LLC DC-DC converter. Furthermore, the proposed framework can be extended to electronic-involved distributed multi-energy systems and serve as a valuable tool for future research.},
