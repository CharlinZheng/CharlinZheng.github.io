abstract: Power electronic systems are characterized by multiple time scales, which
  makes simulation difficult. Current simulation tools are plagued with problems such
  as long simulation times, non-convergent results, and insufficient models. This
  paper proposes a co-simulation framework based on hybrid time-event synchronization
  that combines time-driven SIMULINK simulation algorithm and event-driven DSIM power
  electronics simulation algorithm, offering the benefits of fast convergence from
  DSIM and a rich model library from SIMULINK. The co-simulation framework takes the
  advantages of fast convergence from DSIM and rich model library from SIMULINK. The
  accuracy and efficiency of the proposed framework are validated through the case
  study of LLC DC-DC converter. Furthermore, the proposed framework can be extended
  to electronic-involved distributed multi-energy systems and serve as a valuable
  tool for future research.
