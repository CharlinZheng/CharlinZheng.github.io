 abstract = {SiC devices exhibit superior fast switching speed and low on-resistance compared to silicon devices. However, the impact of non-ideal characteristics of SiC MOSFET on switching losses and thermal impacts requires further investigation. In this paper, a transient loss model for SiC MOSFET and SiC Schottky barrier diode (SBD) switching pairs is presented, wherein the transient process analysis is simplified through the implementation of time segmentation. An electro-thermal simulation is conducted to calculate the junction temperature and update temperature-related parameters through the proposed loss model and thermal network model. The experimental validation is performed using the CREE CMF20120D SiC MOSFET device, with the results confirming the accuracy of the model. The parameters of the loss model can be extracted from the device datasheet, making it suitable for practical power electronics design.},
