abstract: SiC devices exhibit superior fast switching speed and low on-resistance
  compared to silicon devices. However, the impact of non-ideal characteristics of
  SiC MOSFET on switching losses and thermal impacts requires further investigation.
  In this paper, a transient loss model for SiC MOSFET and SiC Schottky barrier diode
  (SBD) switching pairs is presented, wherein the transient process analysis is simplified
  through the implementation of time segmentation. An electro-thermal simulation is
  conducted to calculate the junction temperature and update temperature-related parameters
  through the proposed loss model and thermal network model. The experimental validation
  is performed using the CREE CMF20120D SiC MOSFET device, with the results confirming
  the accuracy of the model. The parameters of the loss model can be extracted from
  the device datasheet, making it suitable for practical power electronics design.
