abstract: Advancing the dynamics inference of power electronic systems (PES) to the
  real-time edge-side holds transform-ative potential for testing, control, and monitoring.
  How-ever, efficiently inferring the inherent hybrid continu-ous-discrete dynamics
  on resource-constrained edge hardware remains a significant challenge. This letter
  pro-poses a neural substitute solver (NSS) approach, which is a neural-network-based
  framework aimed at rapid accurate inference with significantly reduced computational
  costs. Specifically, NSS leverages lightweight neural networks to substitute time-consuming
  matrix operation and high-order numerical integration steps in traditional solvers,
  which transforms sequential bottlenecks into highly parallel operation suitable
  for edge hardware. Experimental vali-dation on a multi-stage DC-DC converter demonstrates
  that NSS achieves 23x speedup and 60% hardware resource reduction compared to traditional
  solvers, paving the way for deploying edge inference of high-fidelity PES dynamics.
