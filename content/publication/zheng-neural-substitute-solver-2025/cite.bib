 abstract = {Advancing the dynamics inference of power electronic systems (PES) to the real-time edge-side holds transform-ative potential for testing, control, and monitoring. How-ever, efficiently inferring the inherent hybrid continu-ous-discrete dynamics on resource-constrained edge hardware remains a significant challenge. This letter pro-poses a neural substitute solver (NSS) approach, which is a neural-network-based framework aimed at rapid accurate inference with significantly reduced computational costs. Specifically, NSS leverages lightweight neural networks to substitute time-consuming matrix operation and high-order numerical integration steps in traditional solvers, which transforms sequential bottlenecks into highly parallel operation suitable for edge hardware. Experimental vali-dation on a multi-stage DC-DC converter demonstrates that NSS achieves 23x speedup and 60% hardware resource reduction compared to traditional solvers, paving the way for deploying edge inference of high-fidelity PES dynamics.},
