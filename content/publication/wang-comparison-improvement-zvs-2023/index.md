abstract: Modular multi active bridge (MMAB) converter, which is the core of high-frequency-link-based
  power electronic transformers, can provide multiple dc ports for flexible interconnection
  among regional power grids with different voltage levels and forms. Besides merits
  of galvanic isolation and exceptional scalability, MMAB converters have inherent
  zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) turn-on operation under phase-shift modulation, which
  substantially reduces switching losses and leads to high efficiency. However, ZVS
  characteristics of the converters cannot be guaranteed under traditional single
  phase-shift modulation. Therefore, modulation techniques with additional control
  degrees of freedom, such as common phase-shift and universal phase-shift modulation
  strategies, are introduced to improve the ZVS performance of the converters over
  a wide operation range. A comparison of ZVS operation under diverse modulation strategies
  is analyzed in detail, and experimental results with tested efficiencies under extreme
  conditions have verified the ZVS analysis and improved effects.
