abstract: Power electronic system (PES) are gradually utilized in dynamic environments
  such as renewable energy generation, electric propulsion, and vehicle charging,
  among others. However, dynamic environmental factors introduce stochastic and nonlinear
  behaviors in PES, challenging controller design. This paper presents an FPGA-based
  real-time X-in-the-loop (XIL) simulation testbench that accounts for environmental
  factors. Specifically, a stochastic analysis model, along with a hybrid implicit/explicit
  solver are developed to assess the introduced nonlinearity and stochasticity. The
  advantages of the XIL testbench are underscored through a case study featuring a
  350kW wireless charging system including 28 switches. The XIL testbench attains
  about 1/4 step size utilizing merely half the computational resources on the same
  FPGA compared to commercial testbenches, while further supporting stochastic and
  nonlinear simulations. Comparisons with offline software and commercial testbench
  validate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed testbench in handling stochastic
  and nonlinear behaviors, offering a viable solution for efficiently testing controllers
  in dynamic environments.
