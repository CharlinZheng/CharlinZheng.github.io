 abstract = {Power electronic system (PES) are gradually utilized in dynamic environments such as renewable energy generation, electric propulsion, and vehicle charging, among others. However, dynamic environmental factors introduce stochastic and nonlinear behaviors in PES, challenging controller design. This paper presents an FPGA-based real-time X-in-the-loop (XIL) simulation testbench that accounts for environmental factors. Specifically, a stochastic analysis model, along with a hybrid implicit/explicit solver are developed to assess the introduced nonlinearity and stochasticity. The advantages of the XIL testbench are underscored through a case study featuring a 350kW wireless charging system including 28 switches. The XIL testbench attains about 1/4 step size utilizing merely half the computational resources on the same FPGA compared to commercial testbenches, while further supporting stochastic and nonlinear simulations. Comparisons with offline software and commercial testbench validate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed testbench in handling stochastic and nonlinear behaviors, offering a viable solution for efficiently testing controllers in dynamic environments.},
