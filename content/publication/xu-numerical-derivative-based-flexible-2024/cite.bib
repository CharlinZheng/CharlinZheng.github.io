 abstract = {Simulation is an efficient tool in the design and control of power electronic systems. However, quick and accurate simulation of them is still challenging, especially when the system contains a large number of switches and state variables. Conventional general-purpose integration algorithms assume nonlinearity within systems but face inefficiency in handling the piecewise characteristics of power electronic switches. While some specialized algorithms can adapt to the piecewise characteristics, most of these methods require systems to be piecewise linear. In this article, a numerical derivative-based flexible integration algorithm is proposed. This algorithm can adapt to the piecewise characteristic caused by switches and have no difficulty when nonlinear nonswitching components are present in the circuit. This algorithm consists of a recursive numerical scheme that obtains high-order time derivatives of nonlinear components and a decoupling strategy that further increases computational efficiency. The proposed method is applied to solve a motor derive system and a large-scale power conversion system to verify its accuracy and efficiency by comparing experimental waveforms and simulated results given by commercial software. Our proposed method demonstrates several-fold acceleration compared to multiple commonly used algorithms in Simulink.},
