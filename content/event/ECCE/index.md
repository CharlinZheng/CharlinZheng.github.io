Iâ€™m honored to serve as a Session Chair at the upcoming ECCE 2025. I will be chairing the following three technical sessions:

- **Modeling & Mitigation of Power Converter EMI**
  Room 103C | Wednesday, October 22 at 10:30 AM

- Modulation Methods for Power Converters
  Room 201C | Wednesday, October 22 at 4:00 PM

- Power Converter EMI *(Poster Session)*
  Poster Area 7 | Tuesday, October 21 at 2:10 PM

In addition to these responsibilities, I will also be delivering **two oral presentations** on my recent research in power electronics and digital twins. I warmly invite colleagues and researchers in the field to join these sessions for insightful discussions and exchange of ideas.

Looking forward to seeing you at ECCE 2025!
