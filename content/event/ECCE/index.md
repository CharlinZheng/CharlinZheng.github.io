I‚Äôm honored to serve as a **Session Chair** at the upcoming **IEEE Energy Conversion Congress & Exposition (ECCE) 2025**, which will be held in **Philadelphia, PA**, this October. I will be chairing the following three technical sessions:

* **Modeling & Mitigation of Power Converter EMI**
  üìç *Room 103C* | üïô *Wednesday, October 22 at 10:30 AM*

* **Modulation Methods for Power Converters**
  üìç *Room 201C* | üïì *Wednesday, October 22 at 4:00 PM*

* **Power Converter EMI** *(Poster Session)*
  üìç *Poster Area 7* | üïë *Tuesday, October 21 at 2:10 PM*

In addition to these responsibilities, I will also be delivering **two oral presentations** on my recent research in power electronics and digital twins. I warmly invite colleagues and researchers in the field to join these sessions for insightful discussions and exchange of ideas.

Looking forward to seeing you at ECCE 2025!
